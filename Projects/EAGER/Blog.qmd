In a study from CSU Fullerton, scientists used **transcriptomic data** to explore how human cells respond to heat shock at the molecular level. Their findings revealed both expected and unexpected stress responses, offering new insight into how cells cope under pressure [@reinschmidt2023].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What is Heat Shock Response?

::: {.callout-important title="Recall the time you were sick?"}
You might have a had fever. This caused your body to undergo alot of stress, but instead of shutting down, it activates protective systems to help you recover and keep going.
:::

All cells experience some form of stress, whether from heat, toxins, or infections. Heat stress, in particular, can cause proteins inside cells to misfold. When this happens, cells activate the **Heat Shock Response (HSR),** their built-in survival system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What are Heat Shock Proteins?

Once the HSR is triggered, cells begin producing special proteins called **heat shock proteins (HSPs)**. Their job includes:

-   Help proteins fold correctly

-   Repair damaged ones

-   Prevent future protein misfolding

::: {.callout-tip title="How is this Relevant?"}
In the CSU Fullerton study, researchers observed the *expected* activation of classic heat shock proteins like **HSP70 and HSP90**. But they also found activation of **non-canonical responses** which are genes not traditionally associated with heat shock [@reinschmidt2023].
:::

This suggests the HSR is **more complex and far-reaching than we previously thought**, with variations depending on the cell type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Cancer Cells Survival Strategy

::: {.callout-important title="The Problem with Cancer Cells"}
Cancer cells are under constant stress. Low oxygen, exposure to radiation, and chemotherapy are just a few. But instead of dying under this pressure (as treatments intend), cancer cells ramp up their production of HSPs. **Cancer cells hijack the heat shock response** **to avoid death.**
:::

By overactivating the HSR, cancer cells become **practically immune**, withstanding chemotherapy, radiation, and other treatments that would normally kill them. This ability to exploit the heat shock response is part of what makes cancer so difficult to treat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Our Offense to Cancers Defense

The discovery of **non-canonical HSR pathways** opens new possibilities for cancer treatment. If we can figure out how to **selectively block the amplified heat shock response in cancer cells**, we could make them more vulnerable to therapy.

In other words, disabling cancer’s stress-coping tricks could **improve the effects of chemotherapy** and other treatment outcomes. Understanding how cancer cells produce HSPs differently than normal cells is key to reaching the full potential of cancer therapy.

::: {.callout-tip title="Takeaway"}
This research shows how **basic cell biology** is important to **real-world medicine.** By uncovering new information on heat shock response, scientists have identified new targets to research that could be used to outsmart cancer and possibly other diseases that exploit stress responses
