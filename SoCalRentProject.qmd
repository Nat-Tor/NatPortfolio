# Getting the Raw Data

Finding clean and usable public data turned out to be more challenging than expected. After exploring several sources, I decided to use **Redfin** as my main platform, and relied on **Excel’s web tools** to auto-generate tables directly from listing URLs. I focused on three Southern California counties — **Orange County, Riverside County, and Los Angeles County**.

For each county, I gathered data on three different property types: **houses, condos, and apartments**. While the raw data I pulled was relatively structured, it still required some cleaning.

```{r}
head(SoCalRent)
```

# Data Wrangling

There were a few listings with missing data in certain columns, so for the sake of sanity, I just removed them.

**Price** came in various formats (e.g., `$3,185/mo`, `$1940+/mo`), so I removed dollar signs, commas, and plus signs, then converted the column to numeric.

**Beds** and **Baths** also had inconsistent formats like `1 bed`, `3 beds`, or even ranges like `2–4 beds`. I stripped out the words "bed(s)" and "bath(s)", and for ranges, I took the smallest number. Both columns were then converted to numeric.

**SqFt** was the messiest. It appeared as `1668.00`, `1,970`, or ranges like `410–480`. I removed commas and decimal points (since I didn’t need the `.00`), and again, for ranges, I used the lower bound. This column was also converted to numeric.

For the **address** column, I kept it in case I wanted to refer to the full address later. But I also extracted just the **city** name into a separate column to analyze trends across cities.

Lastly, I removed any listings where either **Beds** or **Baths** were equal to zero.

After cleaning, I was left with **278 observations** out of the original **333**.

```{r}
Rent_Clean <- SoCalRent |>
  #cleaning out any listings that have any empty data for the sake of my sanity
  filter(!is.na(Price), !is.na(Beds), !is.na(Baths), !is.na(SqFt), !is.na(Address)) |>
  # Remove rows where SqFt starts with an en dash (—)
  filter(!str_starts(SqFt, "—")) |>
  mutate(
    # Price column: remove any $, +, /mo and change it to a numeric variable
    Price = str_remove_all(Price, "\\$|,|/mo|\\+"),
    Price = as.numeric(Price),

    # Beds column: take the smallest number of beds and change it to a numeric variable
    Beds = str_extract(Beds, "^\\d+"),
    Beds = as.numeric(Beds),

    # Baths column: take the smallest number of baths and change it to a numeric variable
    Baths = str_extract(Baths, "^\\d+(\\.\\d+)?"),
    Baths = as.numeric(Baths),

    # SqFt column: takeing the first number from ranges, removes and commas or dashes and change it to a numeric variable
    SqFt = str_remove_all(SqFt, ","),  # Remove commas
    SqFt = case_when(
      str_detect(SqFt, "-") ~ as.numeric(str_extract(SqFt, "^[0-9]+")),
      TRUE ~ as.numeric(SqFt)
    ),
    # City Column: I decided to just make a new column "titled city" that was the address column is still there but I have just the city in a seperate column
    City = str_split_fixed(Address, ",", 3)[, 2]
  ) |>
  # If beds or baths is 0, remove the row
  filter(Beds != 0, Baths != 0)
head(Rent_Clean)

```

# Numerical & Categorical Summaries

I decided to look at the data by grouping by County and housing Type. In general the most type of housing was "House (114)". LA have fewer apartment listings even though its more of an urban location. Riverside (tied with LA) with the most house listings fitting the suburban expectation. The listing size for each county is about 90 for each county, which is good for comparison. Looking through the listings its important to take into consideration that some of the cheaper house/condo listings are renting a ROOM within the place.

```{r}
Rent_Clean|>
  tabyl(County,Type)|>
    adorn_totals(c("row", "col"))
Rent_Clean |>
  count(County,Type)|>
ggplot(aes(x = County, y = n, fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Housing Types by County",
       x = "County", y = "Number of Listings")
```

Showing the average and median rent prices by county and housing type. OC houses are more expensive. As expected apartments are the cheapest/afforable option for each county with riverside being the most affordable. Condo prices vary accross the board which could mean newer luxury built condos (think irvine a newer built area) in certain areas and older smaller condos in others(smaller older cities in riverside). The median is less than the mean (specifically in LA and OC). This means that there is a few expensive outlier listings that drive the average up.

```{r}
Rent_Clean |>
  group_by(County, Type)|>
  summarize(mean_price = round(mean(Price, na.rm = TRUE)), 
            median_price = median(Price, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = "drop")
summary_table <- Rent_Clean |>
  group_by(County, Type) |>
  summarize(
    mean.price = round(mean(Price, na.rm = TRUE)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

ggplot(summary_table, aes(x = interaction(County, Type), y = mean.price, fill = County)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("RIV"="#084B83","OC"="#FF66B3","LA"="#42BFDD"))+
  labs(
    title = "Average Rent Price by County and Type",
    x = "County & Type",
    y = "Average Rent Price"
  ) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Using quartiles (top 25% and bottom 75%) I was able to choose a lower bound and upper bound to then find the outliers. As seen the table below– the outliers are way outside of usually rent price.

```{r}
outliers <- Rent_Clean |>
  group_by(County) |>
  mutate(
    Q1 = quantile(Price, 0.25),
    Q3 = quantile(Price, 0.75),
    IQR = Q3 - Q1,
    lower_bound = Q1 - 2 * IQR,
    upper_bound = Q3 + 2 * IQR
  ) |>
  filter(Price < lower_bound | Price > upper_bound)
print(outliers)

ggplot(Rent_Clean, aes(x = County, y = Price, fill = Type)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = 16, outlier.colour = "red", outlier.size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Rent Price Distribution by County and Housing Type",
       x = "County", y = "Rent Price ($)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

Looking at a summary table of mean price, average size, and average beds and baths by housing type and county. I've inclused price per SqFt to compare efficency costs. LA has the highest average SqFt, its also just the most expensive meaning its the least effecient. WHich could mean its high in demand. Riverside has smaller places but cheaper prices so an efficeint price per SqFt. OC has the biggest space.

For apartment prices, they are coonsidered smaller but doesnt necessarily mean the cheapest. for the OC area the average SqFt is 764 with the average price being \$3.42/SqFt. The higher cost mihgt be for convience, ammenities or location..

```{r}
Summary_table <- Rent_Clean|>
  group_by(County, Type)|>
  mutate(price_per_sqft = Price / SqFt) |>
  summarize(
    mean.price= round(mean(Price)),
    mean.SqFt= round(mean(SqFt)),
    mean.beds= round(mean(Beds)),
    mean.baths=round(mean(Baths)),
    mean_price_per_sqft = round(mean(price_per_sqft)),
    .groups = "drop"  )|>
  select(County, Type, mean_price_per_sqft)
print(Summary_table)
```

Finding correlation between Price and beds/baths/SqFt.

Riverside: has a strong relaionship across beds, baths, and sqft. Meaning a pretty uniform housing market. LA: has the strongest corrrelation with SqFt meaning the market is driven by space then the commoditys. OC has medocre correlation meaning some other factors outside of beds, baths, sqft may be influencing the rent. (think schools, neighborhoods etc)

```{r}
# correlation analysis between price and beds
Rent_Clean|>
  group_by(County)|>
  summarise(
Bed_cor=cor(Price, Beds), 
Baths_cor=cor(Price, Baths), 
SqFt_cor=cor(Price, SqFt))
```

```{r}
Rent_Clean |>
  filter(Price < 10000) |>
  mutate(County = as.character(County)) |>
  bind_rows(
    Rent_Clean |>
      filter(Price < 10000) |>
      mutate(County = "All Counties")
  )|>
ggplot(aes(x = Price, fill = County)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 800, color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ County, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Rent Price Distribution: Overall and by County",
    x = "Rent Price ($)",
    y = "Number of Listings"
  )

# Whats the question I'm trying to answer?

For this project, I want to approach rental affordability from a personal angle, while keeping it general enough that others could adapt it to their own situations. My main question is: **What rental listings offer the best value given a specific salary?** It’s a broad question, but the goal is to make it practical and grounded in real-life decision-making.

A common rule of thumb is that individuals shouldn’t spend more than 30% of their income on rent. Based on this, I’ll introduce a **salary** variable to simulate what someone can realistically afford. This variable will help filter out listings that exceed that 30% income threshold.

To make the analysis more flexible, especially for listings with multiple bedrooms, I’m assuming that shared housing is an option. That means I’ll consider a unit affordable if the **rent per bedroom** is within 30% of a person’s monthly income. This way, I can include multi-bedroom apartments that might be affordable when split among roommates.

```{r}
salary <- 60000  # yearly salary
monthly_income <- salary / 12 #calculating monthly paycheck assuming monthly rent payments
max_rent_per_room <- (monthly_income * 0.30) #allowing only 30% of income to be sued for rent
Rent_Clean_Affordable <- Rent_Clean |>
  mutate(
    rent_per_room = Price / Beds,
    affordable = rent_per_room <= max_rent_per_room
  )|>
  filter(affordable== TRUE)
```

# Deciding what listings are better for their price

now i have to deciede whether or not a listing it worth its value. we can begin by looking at SqFt per Price to determine if you getting the most space out of your value.

```{r}
Rent_Clean_Affordable|>
  mutate( 
  sqft_per_dollar = SqFt / Price
  )|>
arrange(desc(sqft_per_dollar))
```

# Investigating Listing

even after all my data cleaning... this listing got thru. I decided to investigate it for the heck of it.

**217 E 29th St Unit 217 And 217 1 2, Los Angeles, CA 90011:** Upon further investigation. This is a listing for 2 units with a total of 4 beds and 4 baths. Meaning each unit has 2 beds and 2 baths. Then the listing explains how each bedroom can house 2-3 people meaning acording to my code, rent cost would only be about \$187 a month give or take a roomate or two. As GREAT of a rent price this seems. On the bright side-the listing seems to be a affordable housing option for someone who really needs it. On the more weary side- the listing seems sketchy and im unfortunately, not interested.
