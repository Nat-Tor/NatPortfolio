After exploring several sources, I decided to use Redfin as my main platform, and relied on Excel’s web tools to auto-generate tables directly from listing URLs. I focused on three Southern California counties: Orange County, Riverside County, and Los Angeles County.\nFor each county, I gathered data on three different property types: houses, condos, and apartments. While the raw data I pulled was relatively structured, it still required some cleaning.\n\n\nShow code\nSoCalRent |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 6) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Sample of Rent Listings Data\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Price = \"Rent ($)\",\n    Beds = \"Bedrooms\",\n    Baths = \"Bathrooms\",\n    SqFt = \"Square Feet\",\n    Address = \"Address\",\n    Type = \"Housing Type\",\n    County = \"County\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  fmt_currency(columns = c(Price), currency = \"USD\") |&gt;\nopt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"cyan\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.font.size = px(12),\n    heading.title.font.size = px(16))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Rent Listings Data\n\n\nRent ($)\nBedrooms\nBathrooms\nSquare Feet\nAddress\nHousing Type\nCounty\n\n\n\n\n$3,195/mo\n4 beds\n2.5 baths\n1668.00\n4001 Landau Ct, Riverside, CA 92501\nhouse\nRIV\n\n\n$4,000/mo\n4 beds\n2 baths\n2200.00\n18590 Roberts Rd, Riverside, CA 92508\nhouse\nRIV\n\n\n$2,300/mo\n2 beds\n1 bath\n900.00\n3468 Wallace St, Jurupa Valley, CA 92509\nhouse\nRIV\n\n\n$3,449/mo\n3 beds\n2.5 baths\n1,970\n531 Atwood Ct, Riverside, CA 92506\nhouse\nRIV\n\n\n$1,850/mo\n1 bed\n1 bath\n400\n2767 Attenborough Dr, Riverside, CA 92503\nhouse\nRIV\n\n\n$1,950/mo\n1 bed\n1 bath\n440\n10671 Sagittarius Dr, Riverside, CA 92503\nhouse\nRIV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Wrangling\nThere were a few listings with missing data in certain columns, so for the sake of sanity, I just removed them.\nPrice came in various formats (e.g., $3,185/mo, $1940+/mo), so I removed dollar signs, commas, and plus signs, then converted the column to numeric.\nBeds and Baths also had inconsistent formats like 1 bed, 3 beds, or even ranges like 2–4 beds. I stripped out the words “bed(s)” and “bath(s)”, and for ranges, I took the smallest number. Both columns were then converted to numeric.\nSqFt was the messiest. It appeared as 1668.00, 1,970, or ranges like 410–480. I removed commas and decimal points (since I didn’t need the .00), and again, for ranges, I used the lower bound. This column was also converted to numeric.\nFor the address column, I kept it in case I wanted to refer to the full address later. But I also extracted just the city name into a separate column in case I wanted to analyze trends by city.\nLastly, I removed any listings where either Beds or Baths were equal to zero. This may affect apartment listing as it would have removed any studios that don’t have bedrooms.\nAfter cleaning, I was left with 278 observations out of the original 333.\n\n\nShow code\nRent_Clean &lt;- SoCalRent |&gt;\n  #cleaning out any listings that have any empty data for the sake of my sanity\n  filter(!is.na(Price), !is.na(Beds), !is.na(Baths), !is.na(SqFt), !is.na(Address)) |&gt;\n  # Remove rows where SqFt starts with an en dash (—)\n  filter(!str_starts(SqFt, \"—\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    # Price column: remove any $, +, /mo and change it to a numeric variable\n    Price = str_remove_all(Price, \"\\\\$|,|/mo|\\\\+\"),\n    Price = as.numeric(Price),\n\n    # Beds column: take the smallest number of beds and change it to a numeric variable\n    Beds = str_extract(Beds, \"^\\\\d+\"),\n    Beds = as.numeric(Beds),\n\n    # Baths column: take the smallest number of baths and change it to a numeric variable\n    Baths = str_extract(Baths, \"^\\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d+)?\"),\n    Baths = as.numeric(Baths),\n\n    # SqFt column: takeing the first number from ranges, removes and commas or dashes and change it to a numeric variable\n    SqFt = str_remove_all(SqFt, \",\"),  # Remove commas\n    SqFt = case_when(\n      str_detect(SqFt, \"-\") ~ as.numeric(str_extract(SqFt, \"^[0-9]+\")),\n      TRUE ~ as.numeric(SqFt)\n    ),\n    # City Column: I decided to just make a new column \"titled city\" that was the address column is still there but I have just the city in a seperate column\n    City = str_split_fixed(Address, \",\", 3)[, 2]\n  ) |&gt;\n  # If beds or baths is 0, remove the row\n  filter(Beds != 0, Baths != 0)\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nRent_Clean |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 6) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Sample of Clean Rent Listings Data\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Price = \"Rent ($)\",\n    Beds = \"Bedrooms\",\n    Baths = \"Bathrooms\",\n    SqFt = \"Square Feet\",\n    Address = \"Address\",\n    Type = \"Housing Type\",\n    County = \"County\",\n    City = \"City\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  fmt_currency(columns = c(Price), currency = \"USD\") |&gt;\nopt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"cyan\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.font.size = px(12),\n    heading.title.font.size = px(16))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Clean Rent Listings Data\n\n\nRent ($)\nBedrooms\nBathrooms\nSquare Feet\nAddress\nHousing Type\nCounty\nCity\n\n\n\n\n$3,195.00\n4\n2.5\n1668\n4001 Landau Ct, Riverside, CA 92501\nhouse\nRIV\nRiverside\n\n\n$4,000.00\n4\n2.0\n2200\n18590 Roberts Rd, Riverside, CA 92508\nhouse\nRIV\nRiverside\n\n\n$2,300.00\n2\n1.0\n900\n3468 Wallace St, Jurupa Valley, CA 92509\nhouse\nRIV\nJurupa Valley\n\n\n$3,449.00\n3\n2.5\n1970\n531 Atwood Ct, Riverside, CA 92506\nhouse\nRIV\nRiverside\n\n\n$1,850.00\n1\n1.0\n400\n2767 Attenborough Dr, Riverside, CA 92503\nhouse\nRIV\nRiverside\n\n\n$1,950.00\n1\n1.0\n440\n10671 Sagittarius Dr, Riverside, CA 92503\nhouse\nRIV\nRiverside\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\nMy goal is to take a broad look at the rental market across these Southern California counties. I want to explore what each county offers in terms of rent and identify any trends that emerge from the listings. Specifically, I’m interested in how different priorities (square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, or overall price) affect where someone might choose to rent.\nFor example, if someone values space, which county offers the most square footage for the price? If they prioritize more bedrooms or bathrooms, where might they get the best deal? I understand that preferences vary, so rather than claiming one county is “best,” my goal is to highlight the trends I observe in each area and offer insights into what renters might expect based on their needs.\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nI decided to look at the data by grouping by County and housing Type. In general the most type of housing was “House (114)”. LA have fewer apartment listings even though its more of an urban location. Riverside (tied with LA) with the most house listings fitting the suburban expectation. The listing size for each county is about 90 for each county, which is good for comparison. Looking through the listings its important to take into consideration that some of the cheaper house/condo listings are renting a ROOM within the place.\n\n\nShow code\nRent_Clean |&gt;\n  count(Type, County) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Type, y = n, fill = County)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = n), \n            position = position_dodge(width = 0.8), \n            vjust = -0.3, size = 3) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n  values = c(\"LA\" = \"#005596\", \"OC\" = \"#FF6720\", \"RIV\" = \"#FFB81C\")\n)+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most Common Housing Types by County\",\n    x = \"Housing Type\", \n    y = \"Number of Listings\"\n  ) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing the average and median rent prices by county and housing type. OC houses are more expensive. As expected apartments are the cheapest/afforable option for each county with riverside being the most affordable. Condo prices vary accross the board which could mean newer luxury built condos (think irvine a newer built area) in certain areas and older smaller condos in others(smaller older cities in riverside). The median is less than the mean (specifically in LA and OC). This means that there is a few expensive outlier listings that drive the average up.\n\n\nShow code\nsummary_table &lt;- Rent_Clean |&gt;\n  group_by(County, Type)|&gt;\n  summarize(mean.price = round(mean(Price, na.rm = TRUE)), \n            median.price = median(Price, na.rm = TRUE),\n            .groups = \"drop\")\nsummary_table |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(mean.price))|&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Average Rent Price by County and Type\") |&gt;\n  fmt_currency(\n    columns = c(mean.price, median.price),\n    currency = \"USD\") |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    County = \"County\",\n    Type = \"Housing Type\",\n    mean.price = \"Average Rent\",\n    median.price = \"Median Price\") |&gt;\n  data_color(\n    columns = c(mean.price),\n    colors = col_numeric(\n      palette = c(palette = c(\"#2ecc71\", \"#f1c40f\", \"#e74c3c\")),\n      domain = NULL\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.font.size = px(12),\n    heading.title.font.size = px(16),\n    heading.subtitle.font.size = px(12),\n    data_row.padding = px(5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Rent Price by County and Type\n\n\nCounty\nHousing Type\nAverage Rent\nMedian Price\n\n\n\n\nOC\nhouse\n$7,388.00\n$6,850.00\n\n\nLA\nhouse\n$6,547.00\n$5,995.00\n\n\nOC\ncondo\n$4,385.00\n$4,000.00\n\n\nLA\ncondo\n$3,673.00\n$3,500.00\n\n\nLA\napartment\n$3,525.00\n$2,950.00\n\n\nRIV\nhouse\n$3,169.00\n$3,400.00\n\n\nOC\napartment\n$2,595.00\n$2,535.00\n\n\nRIV\ncondo\n$2,479.00\n$2,400.00\n\n\nRIV\napartment\n$1,885.00\n$1,865.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nRent_Clean |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Type, y = Price, fill = County)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = 16, outlier.colour = \"#e74c3c\", outlier.size = 3)+\n  labs(title = \"Rent Price Distribution by County and Housing Type\",\n       x = \"County\", y = \"Rent Price ($)\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n  values = c(\"LA\" = \"#005596\", \"OC\" = \"#FF6720\", \"RIV\" = \"#FFB81C\"))+\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\") +  # Log scale transformation to make it not so squished\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to define what gets filtered\nFor this project, I want to approach rental affordability from a personal angle, while keeping it general enough that others could adapt it to their own situations. A common rule of thumb is that individuals shouldn’t spend more than 30% of their income on rent. Based on this, I’ll introduce a salary variable to simulate what someone can realistically afford. This variable will help filter out listings that exceed that 30% income threshold.\nTo make the analysis more flexible, especially for listings with multiple bedrooms, I’m assuming that shared housing is an option. That means I’ll consider a unit affordable if the rent per bedroom is within 30% of a person’s monthly income. This way, I can include multi-bedroom apartments that might be affordable when split among roommates.\n\n\nShow code\nsalary &lt;- 60000  # yearly salary\nmonthly_income &lt;- salary / 12 #calculating monthly paycheck assuming monthly rent payments\nmax_rent_per_room &lt;- (monthly_income * 0.30) #allowing only 30% of income to be sued for rent\nRent_Clean_Affordable &lt;- Rent_Clean |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    rent_per_room = Price / Beds,\n    affordable = rent_per_room &lt;= max_rent_per_room\n  )|&gt;\n  filter(affordable== TRUE)\nsummary_affordable &lt;- Rent_Clean_Affordable |&gt;\n  group_by(County, Type)|&gt;\n  summarize(mean.price = round(mean(Price, na.rm = TRUE)), \n            median.price = median(Price, na.rm = TRUE),\n            .groups = \"drop\")\nsummary_affordable |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(mean.price))|&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Average Rent Price by County and Type\") |&gt;\n  fmt_currency(\n    columns = c(mean.price, median.price),\n    currency = \"USD\") |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    County = \"County\",\n    Type = \"Housing Type\",\n    mean.price = \"Average Rent\",\n    median.price = \"Median Price\") |&gt;\n  data_color(\n    columns = c(mean.price),\n    colors = col_numeric(\n      palette = c(palette = c(\"#2ecc71\", \"#f1c40f\", \"#e74c3c\")),\n      domain = NULL\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.font.size = px(12),\n    heading.title.font.size = px(16),\n    heading.subtitle.font.size = px(12),\n    data_row.padding = px(5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Rent Price by County and Type\n\n\nCounty\nHousing Type\nAverage Rent\nMedian Price\n\n\n\n\nLA\nhouse\n$4,360.00\n$4,400.00\n\n\nOC\nhouse\n$4,211.00\n$4,097.50\n\n\nOC\ncondo\n$3,630.00\n$3,957.50\n\n\nRIV\nhouse\n$3,369.00\n$3,449.50\n\n\nLA\ncondo\n$3,276.00\n$3,500.00\n\n\nLA\napartment\n$2,970.00\n$2,797.50\n\n\nOC\napartment\n$2,775.00\n$2,775.00\n\n\nRIV\ncondo\n$2,568.00\n$2,542.50\n\n\nRIV\napartment\n$1,926.00\n$1,950.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Linear Regression Model\n\nWe developed a multiple linear regression model to analyze how rent prices in Southern California are influenced by factors including county, housing type, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. The model reveals several important relationships while controlling for these variables.\n\n\nShow code\nrent_model &lt;- lm(Price ~ County + Type + SqFt + Beds + Baths, \n                 data = Rent_Clean_Affordable)\nrent_model_table &lt;- rent_model |&gt;\n  tidy(\n  )\n\n\nThe number of bedrooms had the strongest and most statistically significant association with rent: each additional bedroom increases rent by approximately $844 on average, holding other factors constant (p &lt; 0.001). Location also matters — rental units in Riverside County tend to cost $718 less than those in Los Angeles County, a difference that is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, rents in Orange County are slightly higher than in LA (by about $189), but this difference is not statistically significant.\nAmong housing types, houses rent for approximately $401 more than apartments (p ≈ 0.035), suggesting a premium for standalone homes. Condos, bathrooms, and square footage did not show significant effects on rent in this model, meaning their estimated influence may be due to chance or confounded by other variables.\nIn summary, the model suggests that bedroom count, housing type (house vs. apartment), and county location are the strongest predictors of rent, while square footage and bathrooms did not contribute meaningfully after accounting for other variables.\n\n\nShow code\nPrediction &lt;- rent_model|&gt;\n  augment( newdata= Rent_Clean_Affordable)\n# Plot the residuals\nggplot(data = Prediction, aes(x = .resid)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = \"#8be9fd\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Residuals\",\n       x = \"Residuals\",\n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis histogram visualizes the distribution of residuals from the multiple linear regression model. The residuals are mostly centered around zero, indicating that the model generally makes accurate predictions. However, there is a slight skew to the left, suggesting that the model tends to overestimate rent prices for a number of listings. This imbalance could point to specific property types or counties where the model’s assumptions don’t hold as well. Overall, the residuals do not show extreme deviation from normality, supporting the model’s reasonable fit, but there may still be room for improvement by exploring interaction terms or non-linear relationships.\n\n\nShow code\n# correlation analysis between price and beds\nRent_Clean|&gt;\n  group_by(County)|&gt;\n  summarise(\nBed_cor=cor(Price, Beds), \nBaths_cor=cor(Price, Baths), \nSqFt_cor=cor(Price, SqFt))\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  County Bed_cor Baths_cor SqFt_cor\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 LA       0.570     0.494    0.729\n2 OC       0.450     0.539    0.598\n3 RIV      0.901     0.782    0.799\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nRent_Clean |&gt;\n  filter(Price &lt; 10000) |&gt;\n  mutate(County = as.character(County)) |&gt;\n  bind_rows(\n    Rent_Clean |&gt;\n      filter(Price &lt; 10000) |&gt;\n      mutate(County = \"All Counties\")\n  )|&gt;\nggplot(aes(x = Price, fill = County)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 800, color = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ County, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Rent Price Distribution: Overall and by County\",\n    x = \"Rent Price ($)\",\n    y = \"Number of Listings\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXTRA: take a peak at some listings\nI’ve decided to look at the most expensive and the cheapest listing throughly. even after all my data cleaning… this listing got thru. I decided to investigate it for the heck of it.\n217 E 29th St Unit 217 And 217 1 2, Los Angeles, CA 90011: Upon further investigation. This is a listing for 2 units with a total of 4 beds and 4 baths. Meaning each unit has 2 beds and 2 baths. Then the listing explains how each bedroom can house 2-3 people meaning acording to my code, rent cost would only be about $187 a month give or take a roomate or two. As GREAT of a rent price this seems. On the bright side-the listing seems to be a affordable housing option for someone who really needs it. On the more weary side- the listing seems sketchy and im unfortunately, not interested.\nRental Description: Our brand new, all-inclusive shared rooms are move-in ready just bring your bag and settle into comfort, convenience, and community in the heart of the city.
