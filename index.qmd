# Hi! :D

I'm **Natalie Torres**, a Statistics major at Cal State Fullerton. This is my portfolio, where I share projects from research programs and classes. Most of my work comes from programs like **EAGER** at CSUF and summer research at **UC Berkeley**, along with my coursework in data science and statistics.

You can also find me online:
