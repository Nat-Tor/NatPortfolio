Hi! I’m Natalie Torres, a math major at Cal State Fullerton, graduating in Spring 2026. I’m especially drawn to data science as I love working with messy data, finding patterns, and turning analyses into clean, meaningful visualizations.

I’m currently part of Project EAGER, where I’ve been exploring genomics, computational analysis, and research communication. This year, I presented my first research poster at SCCUR, which made me excited about pursuing graduate school in statistics or data science.

Outside of academics, I’m all about gaming (Stardew Valley, Minecraft, and recently Balatro) and collecting way too many stickers.

I’m building this portfolio to share what I’ve learned, what I’m working on, and where I’m hoping to grow next.
